## About Mini ERP

This is my most large project that I made, it was made for a company that wanted an especific web app. The bussiness is about installations of elevator, and this app save all informations about the company.

I did this project when I had just learned php and was starting with laravel, so surely it has bad practices but the idea and data modeling can be very good, so you could give me some change requests by opening a new branch since I don't I've had a lot of time to refactor.

## Demo of this App
